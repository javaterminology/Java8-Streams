	 * Collect accepts a Collector which consists of four different operations: a supplier, an accumulator, a combiner and a finisher. 
	 * This sounds super complicated at first, but the good part is Java 8 supports various built-in collectors via the Collectors class. 
	 * So for the most common operations you don't have to implement a collector yourself.*/
